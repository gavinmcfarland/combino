# Template Generation

Misc notes

- vite-env.d.ts is needed for various things like, `import` and importing svgs.

vite-env.d.ts is a TypeScript declaration file used by Vite to provide type definitions for environment variables and other Vite-specific features, particularly within the import.meta.env object. It helps with type safety and autocompletion when working with environment variables in a TypeScript project built with Vite.
